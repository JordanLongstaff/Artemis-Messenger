/**
 * This interface represents information about an object in the game world. It
 * may contain all the information known about that object, or just updates.
 * Every object has the following properties:
 * 
 * - an ID
 * - a type
 * - a position (x, y, z)
 * 
 * Many objects also have a name, but not all of them do, and the name is not
 * guaranteed to be unique. However, any one update is only guaranteed to
 * specify the ID.
 * 
 * 
 * Unspecified properties vs. unknown properties
 * 
 * A property is unspecified if no value has been given for it. Since object
 * update packets typically contain values for properties which have changed,
 * other properties will be unspecified. To avoid instantiating a lot of
 * objects, special values are used to indicate whether a primitive property is
 * unspecified. The documentation for each property's accessor method will tell
 * you what that value is. The "unspecified" value depends on the property's
 * type and what its permissible values are:
 * 
 * BoolState: BoolState.UNKNOWN
 * Other Objects: null
 * Numeric primitives: -1, or the type's MIN_VALUE if -1 is a permissible value
 * 		for that property
 * 
 * An unknown property is one whose purpose is currently unknown. It may have a
 * specified value, but we don't know what that value means. IAN is capable of
 * tracking unknown property values, but this capability is really only useful
 * for people who are trying to determine what these properties mean.
 * 
 * 
 * Updating objects
 *
 * Most packets which update object information produce objects which implement
 * this interface. These objects will contain only the property values that were
 * updated by that packet; all other values will be unspecified. You can use the
 * updateFrom() method to transfer all specified properties from one object to
 * another; this allows you to keep around a single instance that always has the
 * latest known state for that world object.
 * 
 * 
 * Object positions
 * 
 * A sector is a three-dimentional rectangular prism. From the perspective of a
 * ship with a heading of 0 degress, the X axis runs from port to starboard, the
 * Y axis runs up and down, and the Z axis runs bow to stern. The boundaries of
 * the sector are (0, 500, 0) [top northeast corner] to (100000, -500, 100000)
 * [bottom southwest corner]. However, some objects, such as asteroids and
 * nebulae, may lie outside these bounds.
